# A modern approach to using RESTful APIs in Android applications

Android Workshop @ DevTalks for Juniors 2016  
November 12, 2016  
Bucharest, Romania  

The goal of this one-day workshop was to provide insight into modern and efficient ways of connecting Android applications to servers by making HTTP requests to RESTful APIs. We started with a base project where we replaced the HttpUrlConnection client with OkHttp, the manual deserialisation with GSON, and then we added Retrofit. 30 young programmers were present at the workshop, from the total of 62 which registered.

This repository has two branches of interest:
- [pure](https://github.com/eduardvasilache/workshop-devtalks-http/tree/pure) - implemented using HttpUrlConnection, manual deserialisation, AsyncTask
- [libs](https://github.com/eduardvasilache/workshop-devtalks-http/tree/libs) - implemented using OkHttp, GSON, Retrofit
